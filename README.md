# Two FABs in an Android app that uses Java

It's mostly pretty easy! The two screenshots below show the FABs in place, with minimal changes from the default Android Studio base activity template.

The [Intuit sdp library](https://github.com/intuit/sdp) is used to scale the FABs so they don't overlap each other for all possible screen resolutions. Thanks to Intuit for supporting open source!
